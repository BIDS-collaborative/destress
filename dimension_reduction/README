Here's some work on data dimension reduction, and trying to map the emotions to a 2-D plane.
For questions, contact Daniel Seita.

The BIDMach script livejournal.ssc needs to be called from an appropriate directory. Here are some
assumptions:

- That there is a directory called moods_data that contains the moodsByUser.smat.lz4 matrix (not in
  the git repository) that is 132 x 780471. Cory made that for me.
- That one can call BIDMach.models.{LDA,NMF,SFA,ICA}.learner from the directory. Note that ICA isn't
  loaded with the other models now so you need to prepend BIDMach.models to that.

To plot the data, use the Python script livejournal_plots.py. That assumes we have a file called
sorted_moodIDs which contains the sorted moods. This is in the git repository. It also assumes a
directory where the output from the BIDMach script (livejournal.ssc, not the extension name) is
located. You will need to change that.
