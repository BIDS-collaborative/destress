The following line should now run the notebook on port 9999
    \$ ipython notebook

To modify this behavior (including if you move ipython.pem) edit:
    $cfile

You'll also need to open TCP access from your web browser's IP. For example,
using Amazon's EC2 console, click on the security group for your instance and
add an incoming rule for port 9999.

Then, you should be able to point your (local) web browser to:
    https://$myip:9999/

You'll probably need to click through security warnings in Chrome each time.
Firefox should let you save the certificate for future usage.

Your password will be the one you typed above. It's in cleartext, so you can
check if you've forgotten already!
