Flex approach is too slow, so we are shifing gears to word2vec/gensim.

Plan: Automate a script to run ~20-50 Lucene searches via word2Vec on our XML posts, for each keyword/phrases(s).
Results will then be outputted to text files (1 for each of the 79 questions).
Files: queryX.txt and resultX.txt   X : [1:79]
	Steps:
		1) Create queryX.txt for each question
		2) Write script for lucene search
		3) Validate output (visually skim...)
		4) drop output into word2vec
